# Advent of Code 2022

Solutions for the multiple days of AoC 2022 written in Rust.

Each day is contained in a `src/day<number>` folder, and commands like `run`, `test` and `bech` can be run using the `--bin` option:

```sh
cargo run --bin day01
```

The folder `src/dayXX` contains the template to easily bootstrap each new day.
